            <p><b>What is Encryption ?</b><br/>
            The process of converting plaintext or readable data into a coded or scrambled form known as cipher-text, to protect it from unauthorized access or interception is called encryption.</p>
            <p><b> Why Encryption?</b><br/>
            Encryption is a critical component of cybersecurity and data privacy, as it helps to protect against data breaches, cyber attacks, and other forms of unauthorized access to sensitive information.</p>
            <p> Encryption is used to secure a wide range of sensitive data, including financial transactions, personal information, and confidential communications.</p>
            <p><b>What is Decryption ?</b><br/>
            The process of converting the encrypted or ciphertext data back into its original plaintext or readable form is called decryption.</p>
            <p> <b>Why Decryption?</b><br/>
            Decryption is also used in digital signatures and certificate-based encryption systems, where a trusted third-party authority verifies the identity of the sender and ensures that the encrypted data is protected against tampering or interception.</p>
            <p id='lastsent'><b>Why Encrypt your data more securely?</b><br/>
            It's important to note that while encryption and decryption can provide an additional layer of security for sensitive data, they are not foolproof. There are always potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers, so it's important to use encryption and decryption in combination with other security measures, such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and strong authentication protocols.</p>
